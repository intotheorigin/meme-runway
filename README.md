# 🚀 Advanced Meme Coin Implementation
A comprehensive implementation of modern meme token features with enhanced security measures and community-driven tokenomics.

Repo is now public!

## 📋 Features Overview

### Core Token Implementation
- ERC20/BEP20 compliant token standard
- Configurable name, symbol, and total supply
- Decimal precision: 18
- Ownership and access control implementation
- Pausable functionality for emergency situations

### 💰 Advanced Tokenomics

#### Transaction Fee System
- Configurable fee percentages
- Multi-destination fee distribution
  - Liquidity generation: 2%
  - Holder rewards: 2%
  - Marketing/Development: 2%
  - Burn mechanism: 1%
- Fee exclusion list for privileged addresses

#### Reflection System
- Real-time holder rewards distribution
- Automatic reflection calculation
- Configurable reflection rate
- Excluded addresses list (DEX pairs, contracts)

#### Anti-Whale Measures
- Maximum transaction amount (1% of total supply)
- Maximum wallet holdings (2% of total supply)
- Progressive tax rates for large transactions
  - Standard tax: 7%
  - Large trades (>0.5% supply): +3% tax
  - Whale trades (>1% supply): +5% tax

### 🔒 Security Features

#### Trading Protection
- Configurable trading activation delay
- Transaction cooldown period (30 minutes default)
- Blacklist system for suspicious addresses
- Emergency pause functionality
- Multi-signature requirement for critical functions

#### Liquidity Management
- Automatic liquidity generation
- Time-locked liquidity (6 months minimum)
- Minimum liquidity threshold enforcement
- Anti-dump mechanisms

### 🔄 Trading Controls

#### Limits and Restrictions
```solidity
maxTransactionAmount = totalSupply * 1 / 100;  // 1% max transaction
maxWalletSize = totalSupply * 2 / 100;        // 2% max wallet
cooldownTime = 30 minutes;                     // Time between trades
```

#### Blacklist/Whitelist System
- Admin controlled address restrictions
- Automated suspicious activity detection
- Fee exemption whitelist
- Contract interaction blacklist

### 🏦 Treasury Management

#### Marketing Wallet
- Multi-signature requirement (3/5)
- Daily spending limits (0.1% of supply)
- Transparent transaction logging
- Community proposal system

#### Development Fund
- Time-locked vesting schedule
- Milestone-based releases
- Public development roadmap
- Quarterly audit requirements

## 📜 Smart Contract Interface

### Core Functions
```solidity
function transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) external returns (bool)
function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) external returns (bool)
function transferFrom(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount) external returns (bool)
```

### Admin Functions
```solidity
function setFees(uint256 liquidityFee, uint256 reflectionFee, uint256 marketingFee) external onlyOwner
function excludeFromFees(address account) external onlyOwner
function setMaxTxAmount(uint256 amount) external onlyOwner
function setMaxWalletSize(uint256 amount) external onlyOwner
function setTradingEnabled(bool enabled) external onlyOwner
```

### View Functions
```solidity
function isExcludedFromFees(address account) external view returns (bool)
function getTotalFees() external view returns (uint256)
function getHolderRewards(address holder) external view returns (uint256)
```

## 🛠 Setup and Deployment

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v14+
- Hardhat
- OpenZeppelin Contracts

### Installation
```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
npm run compile
```

### Deployment
```bash
npm run deploy:testnet  # For testnet deployment
npm run deploy:mainnet  # For mainnet deployment
```

### Configuration
1. Set token parameters in `config/token.config.js`
2. Configure network settings in `hardhat.config.js`
3. Set initial holders in `scripts/deploy.js`

## 🔍 Security Considerations

### Audited Components
- Base token implementation
- Fee distribution system
- Reflection mechanism
- Trading restrictions

### Best Practices
- Use SafeMath for all calculations
- Implement checks-effects-interactions pattern
- Include emergency pause functionality
- Comprehensive event logging
- Rate limiting for sensitive functions

### Known Limitations
- Gas costs may be high during high network congestion
- Reflection calculations may be expensive for large holder counts
- DEX interactions may fail during extreme volatility

## 📈 Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test

# Run specific test suite
npm run test:tokenomics
npm run test:security
npm run test:trading
```

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This implementation is provided as-is. Users should conduct thorough testing and auditing before deployment. Cryptocurrency investments carry high risk.
